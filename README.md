# Questions
Resolution of questions proposed in the internship test for analysis and development

#Q2 - This problem was solved with a loop of repetition, avoiding the use of recursion, which can overload the memory in the execution of the code.

#Q3 - To facilitate the resolution of the problem, I transformed the "json" dataset into lists, which gives me the possibility to use native functions of the language, such as "sum()", "min()", "max()", "count()" and "index()", making code more efficient and elegant.

#Q4 - In this question, I decided to work with the data in the form of "dictionaries", which facilitated my work, because I could use functions native to the language to accomplish the objective of the question, such as "sum()" and "items()".

Q5 - As requested by the problem, for this question no native language function was used to reverse the string. To solve the problem, I traversed the string entered by the user backwards and added each character to an empty array. Then I used the native function "join()" to transform the array into a string.
